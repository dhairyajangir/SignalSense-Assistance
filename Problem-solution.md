# Problem & Solution

## Problem

### 1. Crisis Within a Crisis

In disaster and conflict zones, an invisible mental health crisis often runs parallel to the physical one. Survivorsâ€”especially children and displaced studentsâ€”live in high-stress, resource-deprived environments where trauma, fear, and uncertainty are constant.
Crowding, chaos, and emotional exhaustion make it nearly impossible for individuals to communicate their needs or boundaries effectively.

### 2. Communication Breakdown

* Survivors lose their ability to express emotional states non-verbally.
* Aid workers struggle to identify who needs space versus who needs interaction.
* Conventional mental health systems are either unavailable or inaccessible.
* Language and cultural barriers further complicate communication and care delivery.

### 3. Systemic Gaps

Traditional psychological first aid (PFA) programs often overlook the importance of **non-verbal communication** in emergency response.
In many shelters and refugee camps, there is **no standardized mechanism** for survivors to signal distress, request help, or assert boundaries safely and quickly.

## Solution

### 1. The Signal Band System

The **Signal Band System** introduces a simple, low-cost, and universal method of non-verbal emotional communication using two colored wristbands:

| Band Color | Meaning                                        | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ðŸŸ¢ Green      | "I am stable or open to interaction."          | Encourages social connection, play, and dialogue.            |
| ðŸ”´ Red        | "I need space or non-confrontational support." | Signals distress, emotional boundaries, and a need for calm. |

This system is:

* **Low-tech**: Requires no power, internet, or digital device.
* **Low-cost**: Easily mass-produced and distributed.
* **Universal**: Works across languages, cultures, and literacy levels.
* **Rapidly Deployable**: Can be taught to aid workers in under 5 minutes.
