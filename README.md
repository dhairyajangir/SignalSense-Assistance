# SignalSense Assistant

## Why I Made This App

When disaster strikes, the mental health crisis often goes unnoticed amidst the chaos. Survivors, especially children and displaced students, are left in high-stress environments where trauma and crowding strip them of their personal agency and ability to communicate their emotional needs. Traditional mental health systems fail to reach these communities, leaving them vulnerable and unsupported.

I created SignalSense Assistant to address this gap. Inspired by the Signal Band System—a zero-tech, low-cost communication model—I wanted to build a tool that could provide emotional resilience and clear non-verbal communication in crisis zones. My goal was to create a digital solution that complements the physical Signal Band System, offering a scalable and accessible way to support individuals in need.

## The Problem

1. **The Crisis Within a Crisis**
   - In disaster zones, the invisible mental health crisis often goes unnoticed.
   - Survivors, especially children and displaced students, face high-stress, resource-constrained environments.
   - Trauma and crowding strip individuals of their ability to non-verbally communicate their emotional needs or boundaries.
   - Traditional mental health systems are unavailable or fail to reach these communities.

2. **The Solution**
   - The Signal Band System is a non-verbal, personal communication model designed for crowded, chaotic crisis environments.
   - It uses two simple, durable, colored wristbands (e.g., Green and Red) to signal an individual's emotional state:
     - **Green**: "I am open to interaction, or I am stable."
     - **Red**: "I need space, non-confrontational support, or de-escalation."
   - Target users include displaced students, children in shelters, and aid workers in crisis zones.

3. **Feasibility and Accessibility**
   - Designed for low-resource, high-pressure environments.
   - Requires zero power, zero internet, and zero institutional support.
   - Extremely low-cost and easily mass-produced.
   - Training requires only a 5-minute session for aid workers and shelter staff.

4. **Impact and Intelligence**
   - Restores personal agency and control to survivors in chaotic environments.
   - Allows individuals to signal distress non-confrontationally, aiding de-escalation.
   - Scalable to any crisis zone globally, regardless of language or infrastructure.
   - Advocates for the "Signal Band Protocol" to be a mandatory component of psychological first aid in shelters and refugee camps.

## Challenges I Faced

Building SignalSense Assistant was not without its challenges. The biggest hurdle was ensuring the app could function effectively in low-resource environments. I had to design a system that was simple, intuitive, and universally accessible. Integrating the Signal Band System's principles into a digital tool required careful consideration of user experience and scalability.

Another challenge was addressing the technical limitations of crisis zones, such as lack of internet connectivity and power. I had to ensure the app could provide value even in offline scenarios, complementing the physical Signal Band System.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the `VITE_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to your Gemini API key.
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Conclusion

SignalSense Assistant is more than just an app—it's a step towards restoring hope, stability, and psychological safety in crisis zones. By combining the simplicity of the Signal Band System with the scalability of digital tools, I hope to make a meaningful impact on the lives of survivors and aid workers worldwide.
