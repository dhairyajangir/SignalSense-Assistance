## > Why I Made This

When disaster strikes, the mental health crisis often goes unnoticed amidst the chaos. Survivors, especially children and displaced students, are left in high-stress environments where trauma and crowding strip them of their personal agency and ability to communicate their emotional needs. Traditional mental health systems fail to reach these communities, leaving them vulnerable and unsupported.

I created SignalSense Assistant to address this gap. Inspired by the Signal Band System—a zero-tech, low-cost communication model—I wanted to build a tool that could provide emotional resilience and clear non-verbal communication in crisis zones. My goal was to create a digital solution that complements the physical Signal Band System, offering a scalable and accessible way to support individuals in need.
